Earning Money:

    Since there is a class system implemented this season, a lot of custom items are not available to everyone equally.
     
 So crafting items in your class speciality then selling them on the auction house should be a good way to make money
 
 The Server will also want special items! Whenever the server needs items it will issue a `Server Mission` where all players will have a chance to complete it for money / items / xp / all of the above.
 
 Since some players don't want their items to sit on the AH for days, weeks, months, before it is sold, there will be a online merchant that you can also sell goods to. To sell goods to the merchant the items must be in your inventory then /sync your account to the server. Go online see the average price for your item and BOW! Items gone and Moeny in account.
    
    This is ment for Items that are too hard or take too long to sell, to make quick money.
    The Merchant dosent pay top dollar but he pays quick!
