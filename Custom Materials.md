# Custon Materials
## Steel
Crafting = 1 Gold + 3 Iron

Slightly better damaging than an Iron Sword

## Fire Stone
Crafting = 1 Cobblestone + 1 lava Bucket + 1 Magma Block

About the same as Stone but deals better Fire Damage and longer Fire tick


## Aquatic Stone
Tube Blue Coral Block ID 387 META = 0

Deals more damage when fighting in water!


## Safire
Light Blue Glazed Terracotta ID  = 223 

A diamond upgrade with faster swing!

This would be a great main sword
